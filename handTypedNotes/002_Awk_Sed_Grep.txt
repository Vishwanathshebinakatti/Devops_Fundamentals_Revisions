awk, sed, grep are the text proccessing commands

1.Awk

    $0-entire line, $1-first word , $2-second word of the line.

    general syntax-> awk 'pattern {action}' file

            PP      28 ltts     1years
            AS      30 ltimt    2YEARS



            ex-> awk '{print $1, $4} file O/p-Vishwa 3years
            ex-> awk '$3 === LTIMT {print $1} file o/p- AS
            ex-> awk  '{sum += $4} END {print "total salary:",sum} file  o/p-6
            sum += $4, awk converts the string to a number by taking the number at the start of the string.
