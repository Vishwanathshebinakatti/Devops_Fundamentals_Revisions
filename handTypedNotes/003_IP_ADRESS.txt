10.0.0.0/16 -> CIDR Notation (Classless inter domain range)

1. vpc range
    so here range of the network will be 16 means first two bits 8 and 8 so next 255 is remaining 

    like -> 10.0.255.255 -> this is 255*255 available

2. Subnet range - first 3 bits are fixed then last bit is variable 
    vpc is further devided into subnet - that is 10.0.0.0/16 then its 
        10.0.1.0/24 -> 10.0.1.0 to 10.0.1.255
        10.0.2.0/24 -> 10.0.2.0 to 10.0.2.255
        10.0.3.0/24 -> 10.0.3.0 to 10.0.3.255
